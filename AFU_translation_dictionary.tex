Package & Normalization / translation notes\\\\
\hline
W0\_KATO\_R0 & period: not used directly for A0\_w output; still declare if L-values appear; lambda\_trans: N/A or 1 (if no L-value normalization is consumed); notes: Package gives structural Selmer control; valuation identity belongs to M0.\\
M0\_IMC\_ORDINARY & period: declare: Neron vs optimal period; sign convention; torsion: declare whether torsion factor is included in formula; tamagawa: declare whether cp factors are included and how; lambda\_trans: explicit translation scalar aligning external conventions to t\_BK\\
R1\_GZ\_KOLY & period: if L' appears, declare conventions; otherwise N/A; lambda\_trans: declare if comparing heights/periods to t\_BK conventions\\
M0\_IMC\_SUPERSINGULAR\_PLUSMINUS & period: declare the p-adic L-function normalization (Pollack ±, or signed variants) and its period choice; torsion: declare torsion convention if included in external BSD-style statement; tamagawa: declare whether bad-prime Tamagawa factors are built-in or handled separately; lambda\_trans: explicit translation scalar aligning signed p-adic L-function conventions to t\_BK; notes: Umbrella entry; prefer the split packages M0\_IMC\_SUPERSINGULAR\_AP0 and M0\_IMC\_SUPERSINGULAR\_APNE0 for explicit hypotheses/citations.\\
L\_BAD\_REDUCTION\_LOCAL & period: N/A locally; tamagawa: declare cp convention (connected component index) used by both sides; lambda\_trans: usually 1 if both sides use the same Tamagawa matching convention; otherwise declare; notes: This is where Gate L's 'Tamagawa matching' is certified against the external package conventions.\\
D2\_DYADIC\_LOCAL & period: declare any special dyadic period conventions; tamagawa: declare c\_2(E) convention and whether it is absorbed; lambda\_trans: declare if dyadic package uses different normalizations from the main (odd p) packages; notes: Default global flow treats p=2 as an explicit exceptional place; include this package only if a concrete dyadic reference is adopted.\\
M0\_IMC\_SUPERSINGULAR\_AP0 & period: declare Pollack ± p-adic L-function normalization and associated period choice; torsion: declare torsion convention if included in external BSD-style statement; tamagawa: declare whether bad-prime Tamagawa factors are built-in or handled via L\_BAD\_REDUCTION\_LOCAL; lambda\_trans: explicit translation scalar aligning signed conventions to t\_BK; notes: Keep the signed (±) conventions explicit; do not merge with ordinary M0.\\
M0\_IMC\_SUPERSINGULAR\_APNE0 & period: declare signed p-adic L-function normalization and period choice; torsion: declare torsion convention if included; tamagawa: declare whether bad-prime Tamagawa factors are built-in or handled via L\_BAD\_REDUCTION\_LOCAL; lambda\_trans: explicit translation scalar aligning signed conventions to t\_BK; notes: This is distinct from the a\_p=0 ± theory; keep separate IDs.\\
M1\_RANK1\_PPART\_BSD & period: declare whether the leading term uses Néron vs optimal period, and any p-adic height normalization; torsion: declare torsion factor convention; tamagawa: declare how Tamagawa factors enter; use L\_BAD\_REDUCTION\_LOCAL if separated; lambda\_trans: explicit translation scalar aligning external rank-1 normalizations to t\_BK; notes: This package complements AFU-3 (rank bridge) by providing the valuation/index identification in rank 1.\\
